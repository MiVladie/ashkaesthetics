				main='What are the difference between Profhilo and Dermal Fillers?'
				description='Whilst traditional dermal fillers also contain hyaluronic acid, the key difference between the two treatments is that Profhilo doesnâ€™t add volume or change the structure of the face. Dermal fillers are used to augment a specific area via a lifting and volumising effect. They do give the skin greater luminosity, but Profhilo takes a more holistic approach for widespread improvement'
